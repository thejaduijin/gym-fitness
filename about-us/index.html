            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p class="about-our-zym-para">
              Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 as a family owned and operated
              business. The Gym and Fitness founders didn’t want it to be just
              another gym equipment retailer - they wanted to be the best in the
              industry and set their minds to doing so! Since its birth, Gym and
              Fitness has grown into one of Australia’s largest online fitness
              equipment retailers having helped over 50,000 customers live
              longer, happier and healthier lives
